*
* We will write Typescript but compile to Javascript before publishing, this
* is why on the npm install below we use the "--save-dev" so it will only before
* in the devleopment enviroment.
*
tsc --init
npm install typescript del-cli --save-dev
*
* In the package.json, delete the test script and add a build script for the typescript compiler.
*    "build": "tsc"
*
* Then edit the tsconfig.json file as follows:
*  uncomment:  "declaration": true,
*  set      :  "outDir": "./build"
*
* npm run build
*
* IN the package.json we need to point to file that will be included when we import this
* and that is the "main", we also added the "types" for typescript and the "files" controls
* which files are included.

  "main": "./build/index.js",
  "types": "./build/index.d.ts",
  "files": [
    "build/**/*"
  ],
*
* use npm version patch to update the version number in the package.json
npm version patch
npm run build
npm publish
